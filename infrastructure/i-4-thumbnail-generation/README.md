# I-4 Thumbnail Generation

**Status:** Architecture Decision Complete — Ready for Implementation Decision

---

## Quick Summary

Three architectures evaluated for thumbnail extraction in ProChat OS video pipeline.

### Decision: MediaConvert Native Frame Capture ✅ RECOMMENDED

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Recommendation** | MediaConvert native FrameCaptureSettings |
| **Time to MVP** | 2.5-3 hours |
| **Operational complexity** | Minimal (no external services) |
| **Cost per job** | $0.01-0.02 (minimal overhead) |
| **Reliability** | Highest (native AWS service) |
| **Risk** | Lowest (proven approach) |
| **Status** | Ready to implement immediately |

### Key Tradeoff

- **Benefit:** Simplest integration, no build steps, immediate testing
- **Limitation:** Captures at 1-second intervals (not arbitrary timestamps)
- **Mitigation:** Add optional post-processing Lambda if specific timestamp needed (simple file copy)

### Fallback Plan

If frame quality unacceptable or timestamp precision needed:
- **Option 2:** Lambda + ffmpeg layer (code ready, +1-2 hours for layer build)
- **Option 3:** ECS/Fargate (not recommended for MVP)

### 4. Existing Files

**DEPLOYMENT.md** (from previous research)
- Marked BLOCKED (pending ffmpeg Lambda layer)
- Documents I-4.2 Lambda approach (Option 2)
- Preserved for fallback reference

**i4-thumbnail-generation-blocker.md** (updated)
- Previous blocker: Nova Canvas API incompatible
- Current blocker: ffmpeg not in Lambda base image
- Resolution: Recommended MediaConvert instead

**lambda-extract-thumbnail.py**
- Working Lambda code for Option 2 (ffmpeg approach)
- Tested locally, ready for AWS deployment if needed
- Would require ffmpeg Lambda layer to work

**scripts/i4-thumbnail-preflight.sh**
- Proof-of-concept for ffmpeg frame extraction
- Demonstrates feasibility of Option 2
- ✅ PASSED: Frame extracted, uploaded, verified

## Decision Timeline

### Research Phase (COMPLETE)

✅ Investigation of three approaches:
- MediaConvert native capabilities
- Lambda + ffmpeg layer requirements
- ECS/Fargate operational overhead

✅ Evidence gathered:
- AWS API validation for frame capture
- Cost analysis with real pricing
- Operational burden assessment
- Risk evaluation

✅ Recommendation: MediaConvert native frame capture

---

## Implementation Timeline (Next)

### Phase 1: Validation (30 minutes)
1. Create test MediaConvert job with FrameCaptureSettings
2. Submit job to AWS
3. Verify frames captured in S3
4. Measure job time overhead
5. Verify frame quality

### Phase 2: Integration (1-2 hours)
1. Update lambda-mediaconvert.py to include frame capture settings
2. Deploy updated Lambda
3. Test with existing I-3 assets

### Phase 3: Step Functions (1 hour)
1. Update state machine to map frame output
2. Add thumbnail reference to metadata contract
3. End-to-end workflow test

**Total: 2.5-3 hours to MVP completion**

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: MediaConvert Has Frame Capture ✅ CONFIRMED
- AWS MediaConvert API supports FrameCaptureSettings
- Available in eu-north-1 (our region)
- Can capture multiple frames per job
- Can specify frame rate (1/1, 1/2, 1/30, etc.)

### Finding 2: ffmpeg Not in Lambda Base Image ✅ CONFIRMED
- AWS Lambda Python 3.11 does not include ffmpeg
- Would require Lambda layer (1-2 hour build)
- Alternative: MediaConvert native approach

### Finding 3: ECS/Fargate is Overkill ✅ CONFIRMED
- Too much complexity for MVP (~5-8 hours setup)
- Adds idle costs ($10-30/month)
- Only justified at high volume (1000+ jobs/month)

---

## Cost Comparison

### MediaConvert (RECOMMENDED)
- Per job: $0.01-0.02 (minimal overhead)
- Annual (100 jobs/month): $12-24
- Maintenance: $0

### Lambda + ffmpeg
- Per job: $0.00001 (negligible)
- Layer setup: $60-100 (labor)
- Annual maintenance: $30-50 (labor)
- Total annual: ~$120-150 equivalent

### ECS/Fargate (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Per job: $0.05-0.10
- Idle cost: $10-30/month ($120-360/year)
- Setup: 4+ hours
- Annual maintenance: $200+

**Recommendation:** MediaConvert is cost-competitive and simpler.

## Operational Burden

| Aspect | MediaConvert | Lambda+ffmpeg | ECS/Fargate |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Weekly effort | 5 min | 10 min | 30 min |
| Monthly effort | 10 min | 15 min | 1 hour |
| Annual effort | 2 hours | 10 hours | 12+ hours |
| Version management | None | Quarterly | Continuous |
| Idle costs | $0 | $0 | $10-30/month |

**MediaConvert has lowest ongoing burden.**

2. ✅ **Simplicity** — No build steps, immediate testing
3. ✅ **Reliability** — Native AWS service, 99.99% SLA
4. ✅ **Cost** — Minimal overhead compared to existing job
5. ✅ **Operational burden** — No external service management
6. ✅ **MVP timeline** — 2.5-3 hours vs 3-4 hours (Lambda) or 5-8 hours (Fargate)
7. ✅ **Risk level** — Lowest risk among options

**One tradeoff:** Captures at 1-second intervals (not arbitrary timestamps). Acceptable for thumbnail use case.

## Questions This Resolves

**Q: What's the best way to extract thumbnails in ProChat OS?**  
**A:** MediaConvert native frame capture. Simple, proven, low risk.

**Q: Why not just use Lambda + ffmpeg?**  
**A:** Works great, but requires 1-2 hour layer build upfront. MediaConvert is simpler for MVP.

**Q: Could we use ECS/Fargate?**  
**A:** Yes, but it's overkill for MVP. Adds 5-8 hours complexity, $10-30/month idle cost. Revisit at scale.

**Q: What if we need arbitrary timestamps later?**  
**A:** Switch to Lambda + ffmpeg (fallback documented, code ready). Takes 2-3 more hours.
